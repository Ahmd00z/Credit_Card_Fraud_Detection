# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection  

This project develops a **Machine Learning model** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.  
It demonstrates **data exploration, feature engineering, and classification models** for real-time fraud prevention.  

---

## 🔍 Project Overview  

- Built an ML model to classify transactions as **fraudulent or genuine**  
- Applied **data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering**  
- Used algorithms like **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**  
- Achieved effective **real-time fraud detection**  
- Showcases **skills in ML workflow and financial security applications**  

---

## 📊 Dataset  

- Contains anonymized credit card transaction data  
- Includes features such as **transaction amount, time, and engineered variables**  
- Highly imbalanced: fraud cases are rare (~0.17%)  

---

## 🚀 Workflow  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Scaling transaction amounts & time  
   - Train-test split  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Fraud vs non-fraud distribution  
   - Correlation between features  
   - Class imbalance visualization  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

4. **Results**  
   - Models achieved strong fraud detection performance  
   - Random Forest gave the best trade-off between precision & recall
